# Motivation is Key, official MonkeyTeam Discord Bot

Deprecated, please use https://github.com/TheMonkeyPrince/R2 instead

# March 2024 update

## Unparalled monkeys management techniques

### The Accounting entry

The words "Accounting entry" are used to describe a variety of payements that must be made. The name is intentionnaly kept neutral in tone, so that the same
objects and commands can be used for fines (when a monkey fails to follow the laws), or taxes (e.g. for the incoming propaganda website)


# How to setup the bot for development purpose
Important: do not use the real bot (MOTIVATION IS KEY#0999) for development !

1. Get Discord credentials here: https://discord.com/developers/applications

2. Clone this repo
	```
	git clone git@github.com:QuicheLorraine3600/MotivationIsKey.git
	```


3. Install the dependencies
	```
	npm install
	```
	Note: the bot requires TypeScript, you might need to install it by your own

4. Set the env variables TOKEN, CLIENT_ID with your bot credentials. Set the env variable GUILD_ID with your development server. You can create a custom script for that.
